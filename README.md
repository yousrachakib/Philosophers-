introduction to threads and mutexes 

 # I- all you need to know about threads :

In C programming, a thread refers to a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently of other parts of a program. Threads provide a way to achieve concurrent execution within a single program, allowing multiple tasks to be performed simultaneously.The concept of threads is based on the idea of multitasking, where different tasks or operations can be executed concurrently, sharing the same resources of a program. By using threads, you can divide a program into smaller, more manageable units of execution, each with its own set of instructions and data.

## 1.Including the Appropriate Header Files:
To work with threads in C, you need to include the appropriate header files. The most common header file is <pthread.h>, which provides the necessary functions, data types, and macros for thread creation and management.
	#include <pthread.h>

## 2.Creating a Thread:
To create a thread, you typically follow these steps:

a. Define a function that represents the code to be executed by the thread. This function should have a void* return type and take a void* argument.

	void* threadFunction(void* arg) {
    // Code to be executed by the thread
    // ...
    return NULL;
	}
